# TextGrapher-Gem
 A gem that can be used to produce graphs as txt files

For information about specific blocks, please open the test file and the textgrapher file and read the comments.

Notes: this system does not handle fractional values directly, and negative values must be shifted into the range. Also the yield block for graphit can simply pass back the value taken in, this will allow for the graphing of the raw positional data (e.g for scatter plots, or divergent graphs).
